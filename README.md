<div dir="rtl">
 
## Overview 📝

This code acts as a comprehensive toolkit for scientific investigation, covering various methods and techniques for scientific inquiry. It includes the following:

1. **Generating Executable Files with PyInstaller** 🚀: This section utilizes PyInstaller to generate an executable file containing all necessary configurations for running the desired program. It ensures that all required dependencies are bundled within the executable.

2. **Creating RAR Files with Decorative Document and Payload** 📦: This part involves generating a RAR file containing a decorative document (usually a PDF document) and a payload (an executable program that performs malicious operations).

3. **Performing Process Injection** 💉: This section includes code for injecting an executable into another process on the Windows operating system. This is often used for running malicious and stealthy programs.

4. **Using Artificial Intelligence to Evade Detection** 🤖: This section employs artificial intelligence models to detect the likelihood of a malicious program being identified by antivirus software or other security tools.

5. **Utilizing Polymorphic Code to Evade Detection** 🎭: In this section, polymorphic code is used to transform a previously identified malicious program to prevent its detection.

6. **Applying Various Techniques to Hide the Attack** 🕵️‍♂️: This section covers different techniques for hiding malicious programs, including file and process obfuscation.

7. **Employing Persistence Techniques for Continuous Access** 🔐: This part includes techniques used to maintain continuous access of the malicious program to the system, such as creating scheduled tasks and registry keys.

And the rest of the techniques such as using anti-forensics techniques, anti-sandbox techniques, adapting to the target system, social engineering, automating the attack process, evasion techniques, etc., are also described in this code.
